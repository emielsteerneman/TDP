Need an interface / manager for 

1. Files (local files / azure blob)
2. Vectors (pinecone / weaviate)
3. Metadata (Mongo API (mongodb / cosmosdb))

# 1. Files
Basically CRUD. Also enumerate
How do PDF files come in?
File upload? Not really.. don't want users to just upload random stuff (yet). And even then, just move a pdf to a temp folder and pass the filepath.
Filepath. That's better. Can't assume that all required paper information is already neatly in filename.

# 2. Vectors
idk

# 3. Metadata
CRUD and enumerate...
